Create an AWS account(root user) <br/>
Create a non-root user with necessary permissions <br/>
Create a role `GithubActionsRole` with necessary permissions <br/>
Ceate identity provider (OIDC provider) - `token.actions.githubusercontent.com` and assign it to the role - `GithubActionsRole` <br/>

Create S3 bucket and DynamoDB table, to store state<br/>
To understand more about how to connect Github and AWS, I've used this article<br/> 
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/use-iam-roles-to-connect-github-actions-to-actions-in-aws/ <br/>
### GitHub Actions <br/>

<br/>
### Test Terraform locally <br/>
Let's create a dummy s3 bucket to check Terraform code locally <br/>
Add environment variables:
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=""
``` 
Run: <br/>
`terraform init` <br/>
`terraform plan` <br/>
`terraform apply`
