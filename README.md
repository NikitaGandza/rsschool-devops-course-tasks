### AWS setup <br/>
Create an AWS account(root user) <br/>
Create a non-root user with necessary permissions <br/>
Create a role `GithubActionsRole` with necessary permissions <br/>
Ceate identity provider (OIDC provider) - `token.actions.githubusercontent.com` and assign it to the role - `GithubActionsRole` <br/>
NOTE! Updated thumbnail in Endpoint verification from this link: https://github.blog/changelog/2022-01-13-github-actions-update-on-oidc-based-deployments-to-aws/ <br/>
Create S3 bucket `terraform-states-nikita`
<br/>
To understand more about how to connect Github and AWS, I've used this [article] (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/use-iam-roles-to-connect-github-actions-to-actions-in-aws/) <br/>
### GitHub Actions <br/>
Create a script `.github/workflows/blank.yml` to test AWS connection <br/>

<br/>
### Test Terraform locally <br/>
Let's create a dummy s3 bucket to check Terraform code locally <br/>
Add environment variables:
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=""
``` 
Run: <br/>
`terraform init` <br/>
`terraform plan` <br/>
`terraform apply`
